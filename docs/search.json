    "text": "Welcome to my personal website. I’m currently an Environmental Studies student at UCSB, passionate about renewable energy, photography, and outdoor adventures.\nIn my studies I explore the intersection between climate action and hands-on work in the field. Specifically micro-grids, solar PV systems (especially organic), and sustainable energy solutions. I’ve worked on research and technical projects involving data analysis, mapping tools, and some ecological fieldwork.\nIn my free time, you’ll find me hiking, backpacking, or out in the snow."

    "text": "Welcome! This page shares a bit about who I am through landscapes, lenses, and lyrics!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing an avid hiker these are my favorite mountains to explore. San Jacinto and San Gorgonio! Both great places to hike in SoCal. If you are interested in San Jacinto, the Deer Springs Trail is 17.1 miles (out-and-back) of the beatiful San Jacinto wilderness. A section even overlaps with the PCT! San Gorgonio is the highest peak in SoCal at a wopping 11,503FT. My favorite trail to take to the summit is Vivian Creek which is 17.3 miles (out-and-back). If you are up for a real challenge look into the 3-Peaks of SoCal challenge. It involves summiting Mt. Baldy, San Jacinto, and San Gorgonio all in twenty-four hours. I’ve attempted this once and summited Mt. Baldy and San Gorgonio, there’s always next year!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started photography in high school, shooting for the school newspaper and yearbook. Since then I’ve had a strong passion to get out and take photos. Recently I have been into macro/micro-photography of lichen, but I shoot a variety of things. I use a nikon D500 with a collection of different lenses. Here are some recent photos!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic is a part of my everyday life. From when I wake up to when I go to bed, these are the albums I have on repeat! First is One Wayne G by Mac Demarco which is 9hr 30min album with 199 smooth songs. It’s perfect for when you don’t know what to put on. Next is Seychelles by Masayoshi Takanaka. A jazz fusion funk album from the 70s. I was recently lucky enough to see him live for his first performance in LA since the 80s. The album has a great beachy vibe, great for long drives up and down the coast. Lastly is MID AIR by Paris Texas. One of the most energetic, hype-me-up, motivating albums I have ever listened to. This is my go to album when snowboarding, especially Full English!"
