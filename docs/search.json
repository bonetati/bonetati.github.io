    "text": "Welcome to my personal website. I’m currently an Environmental Studies student at UCSB, passionate about renewable energy, photography, and outdoor adventures.\nIn my studies I explore the intersection between climate action and hands-on work in the field. Specifically micro-grids, solar PV systems (especially organic), and sustainable energy solutions. I’ve worked on research and technical projects involving data analysis, mapping tools, and some ecological fieldwork.\nIn my free time, you’ll find me hiking, backpacking, or out in the snow."

There was only one thing I could think to do, SNOW ROAD TRIP!\n###Bishop In the middle of a desert there is a secret oasis, a campsite not to far from town. This is were I spent my first night out on the road. Under the stars, next to a flowing river with a bandit of raccoon and the tune of my radio to keep me company. It was comforting. This may have been the only rest I was going to get.\n###Mammoth Before the sun rose I had my truck packed and was ready to hit the road again. My first real stop was Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort. I’ve been to this resort numerous times and it never gets boring. Luckily today was easy, clear skies, decent groomers, and not very many people. I got a full day of snowboarding in then chilled in the lodge for some post-ride mac n cheese. Next it was off to my family friends.\n###Lake Tahoe I made it just in time for dinner! It was a big family, 7 people, and we went out to eat at a local casino. A night full of laughs and warmth was fulfilling before the next day to come. Waking up, it was drizzling outside nothing terrible just a few drops here and there. Once again I packed my truck and was on my way to the mountain, Palisades. It was a near white out day, you could barely see 30 feet away from you the snow coming down was so hazy. A day full of scary, icey conditions plus a broken phone made it a little tougher to enjoy the mountain. None the less it was still a good day.\n###Redding After a beautiful drive I made it to Redding to stay with my girlfriend’s parents. There was no snowboarding on this part of the trip. Instead we went to zoos, musuems, and even learned about a local cult. It was an interesting change of pace from the previous days, but a welcomed one.\n###Mt. Bachelor This was the big part of the trip. Five whole days at one of the best resorts on the west coast. I shared a place with four other friends who were just as excited as me to be there. The first day was rough, it was raining hard and the snow was choppy. Still I was out there all day. The next couple days followed suit. That was until the fourth day, Mt. Bachelors birthday! The sun was back out better then ever!\n###Reno After tiring out from all the snowboarding, back in reno on the way down I got to keep hanging out with my family friends. With them the most interesting thing we did was go to the thrift store bins (which was actually pretty fun), I walked away with a four speakers and a subwoofer!\n###June Lake The final leg of the trip. It was one that I will never forget. I stayed in a hole in the way motel. It was a place with character. Nothing beats the feeling of June Lake, as you go up the ski lift and get a beautiful view as far as the eye can see of the lake. Snow falling down and chilly in the air, it really did feel likle December for the first time in a while. Next year it will be better then ever! ::::"

    "text": "Welcome! This page shares a bit about who I am through landscapes, lenses, and lyrics!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing an avid hiker these are my favorite mountains to explore. San Jacinto and San Gorgonio! Both great places to hike in SoCal. If you are interested in San Jacinto, the Deer Springs Trail is 17.1 miles (out-and-back) of the beatiful San Jacinto wilderness. A section even overlaps with the PCT! San Gorgonio is the highest peak in SoCal at a wopping 11,503FT. My favorite trail to take to the summit is Vivian Creek which is 17.3 miles (out-and-back). If you are up for a real challenge look into the 3-Peaks of SoCal challenge. It involves summiting Mt. Baldy, San Jacinto, and San Gorgonio all in twenty-four hours. I’ve attempted this once and summited Mt. Baldy and San Gorgonio, there’s always next year!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started photography in high school, shooting for the school newspaper and yearbook. Since then I’ve had a strong passion to get out and take photos. Recently I have been into macro/micro-photography of lichen, but I shoot a variety of things. I use a nikon D500 with a collection of different lenses. Here are some recent photos!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic is a part of my everyday life. From when I wake up to when I go to bed, these are the albums I have on repeat! First is One Wayne G by Mac Demarco which is 9hr 30min album with 199 smooth songs. It’s perfect for when you don’t know what to put on. Next is Seychelles by Masayoshi Takanaka. A jazz fusion funk album from the 70s. I was recently lucky enough to see him live for his first performance in LA since the 80s. The album has a great beachy vibe, great for long drives up and down the coast. Lastly is MID AIR by Paris Texas. One of the most energetic, hype-me-up, motivating albums I have ever listened to. This is my go to album when snowboarding, especially Full English!"
